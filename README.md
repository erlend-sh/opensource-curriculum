*In brief:* A curriculum for The Openness Movement, starting with a narrow focus on software and open source. Whether you’re a newcomer to open source or you’ve been involved with the practice for some time, this curriculum aims to provide a comprehensive overview of everything open source is, and aspires to be.

# Openness Movement Curriculum (v0.1)

This document aspires to become a comprehensive reading list for anyone seeking to deeply understand ‘openness’ as an ideology for knowledge work, a movement, an industry and more.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness
> Openness is an overarching concept or philosophy that is characterized by an emphasis on transparency and collaboration. That is, openness refers to "accessibility of knowledge, technology and other resources; the transparency of action; the permeability of organisational structures; and the inclusiveness of participation". Openness can be said to be the opposite of closedness, central authority and secrecy.

Since openness is such an expansive subject, we will start here with a narrow focus on openness as pertaining to software development and the internet-connected world.

As soon as you start delving into openness in software, you'll begin hearing the term "open source". Before long you'll also learn that there is a difference between what's called "open source" and "free". And you'll learn that these terms are defined both formally and informally. It's important to be aware that no one owns these terms. There is no central authority to say what "open source" means, just like there's no central authority on the term "democracy".

*Open source* isn't limited to just software. Any *thing* with a blueprint that enables said thing to be inspected, duplicated or modified can be regarded as open source. This blueprint could be anything from the complete specification of an airplane, all the way down to the genetic code of a seed. The openness *movement* therefore extends far beyond the confines of software.

This curriculum will focus on teaching:

- What “open source” means
- How openness is applied in software development
- Economic & personal sustainability
- Software ethics

From now on we will talk about the "openness movement" and "open source" somewhat interchangeably. Like it or not, "open source" is being adopted into the mainstream with new meanings attached to it that are way outside the scope of its origins. (See for instance "Open Sourced" by Vox, a publication that is largely values-aligned with the open source movement, but has nothing to do with software licensing and open source practices.)

In the open source spirit, this curriculum is itself open source, I.e. liberally licensed. We will diligently review the change requests that are sent our way, with the intent of having multiple co-editors before long. If someone strongly disagrees with how the editors exercise their final-edit powers, feel free to *fork* this curriculum. If you don’t yet know what that means, you’ll learn very soon!

# What is open source

If you're absolutely new to the very concept of open source, start by watching these two introductory videos.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8fHgx9mE5U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8fHgx9mE5U)

(HELP WANTED: Are you aware of a text/graphical writeup that explains open source in similar fashion to the videos above? We need one of those!)

Creative Commons is also a very plain-English way of understanding the open source ethos through the lense of licensing. CC licenses are primarily intended for artifacts such as books, images and music.

[https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/)

[https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/cc-licenses/](https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/cc-licenses/)

For now this curriculum will focus on software because...

1. Open source software is arguably the furthest ahead of any openness movement.
2. The author(s) of this curriculum are chiefly familiar with software.

# Ideology

## Central authorities for the term “open source”

There is no single authority that ratifies what can be deemed "open source" or not. There are however a few organisations that are widely regarded as highly trusted, and many people believe that their definitions of "open source" should be strictly adhered to. Chief among these is the Open Software Initiative.

Not to be confused with opensource.COM, a advocacy site for open source by the company Red Hat.

## Why make anything open source

At first glance, open source sharing might just seem like charitable giving. A philanthropic endeavor to make the world we inhabit more open to scrutiny and modification. Yet while a sense of charity is certainly felt by many open source contributors, the practical benefits of open source licensing also align perfectly well with [egoistic altruism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvskMHn0sqQ&vl=en) as well as common-sense business strategy.

Economic incentives aside, the open source development methodology is simply an easier, more efficient way to develop software. Openly accessible knowledge gives way to more and better knowledge.
