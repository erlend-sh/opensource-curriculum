*In brief:* A curriculum for students of 'open source' as it is practiced by open source software developers. Whether you’re a newcomer to open source or you’ve been involved with the practice for some time, this curriculum aims to provide a comprehensive overview of everything open source is, and aspires to be.

# Open-Source Curriculum (v0.2.0)

This document aspires to become a comprehensive reading list for anyone seeking to deeply understand ‘openness’ as an ideology for knowledge work, a distributed movement, a commercial industry and more yet to come.

#### Open Source as a subset of openness

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness
> Openness is an overarching concept or philosophy that is characterized by an emphasis on transparency and collaboration. That is, openness refers to "accessibility of knowledge, technology and other resources; the transparency of action; the permeability of organisational structures; and the inclusiveness of participation". Openness can be said to be the opposite of closedness, central authority and secrecy.

Since openness is such an expansive subject, we will start here with a narrow focus on openness as it pertains to software development and the internet-connected world. In software and *tech*, 'open source' is the most commonly practiced form of openness.

As soon as you start delving into *software openness*, you'll begin hearing the term *open source*. Before long you'll also learn that there is a difference between what's called "open source" and "free". And you'll learn that these terms are defined both formally and informally. It's important to be aware that no one owns these terms. There is no central authority to say what "open source" means, just like there's no central authority on the term "democracy".

Open Source (sometimes capitalized!) isn't limited to just software. Any *thing* with a blueprint that enables said thing to be inspected, duplicated or modified can be regarded as open source. This blueprint could be anything from the complete specification of an airplane, all the way down to the genetic code of a seed. The openness *movement* therefore extends far beyond the confines of software.

From now on we will talk about the "openness movement" and "open source" somewhat interchangeably. Like it or not, "open source" is being adopted into the mainstream with new meanings attached to it that are way outside the scope of its origins. See for instance ["Open Sourced" by Vox](https://www.vox.com/open-sourced), a publication that is largely values-aligned with the open source movement, but has nothing to do with software licensing and open source practices.

#### Curriculum highlights

- What “open source” means
- How openness is applied in software development
- Economic & personal sustainability
- Software ethics

In the open source spirit, this curriculum is itself open source, I.e. permissively licensed. We will diligently review the change requests that are sent our way, with the intent of eventually having multiple co-editors. If someone strongly disagrees with how the editors exercise their final-edit powers, feel free to *fork* this curriculum. If you don’t yet know what that means, you’ll learn very soon!

# What is open source

If you're absolutely new to the very concept of open source, start by watching these two introductory videos.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8fHgx9mE5U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8fHgx9mE5U)

(HELP WANTED: Are you aware of a text/graphical writeup that explains open source in similar fashion to the videos above? We need one of those!)

Creative Commons is also a very plain-English way of understanding the open source ethos through the lense of licensing. CC licenses are primarily intended for artifacts such as books, images and music.

[https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/)

[https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/cc-licenses/](https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/cc-licenses/)

For now this curriculum will focus on software because...

1. Open source software is arguably the furthest ahead of any openness movement.
2. The author(s) of this curriculum are chiefly familiar with software.

# Ideology

## Central authorities for the term “open source”

There is no single authority that ratifies what can be deemed "open source" or not. There are however a few organisations that are widely regarded as highly trusted, and many people believe that their definitions of "open source" should be strictly adhered to. Chief among these is the Open Software Initiative.

## Why make anything open source

At first glance, open source sharing might just seem like charitable giving. A philanthropic endeavor to make the world we inhabit more open to scrutiny and modification. Yet while a sense of charity is certainly felt by many open source contributors, the practical benefits of open source licensing also align perfectly well with [egoistic altruism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvskMHn0sqQ&vl=en) as well as common-sense business strategy.

Economic incentives aside, the open source development methodology is simply an easier, more efficient way to develop software. Openly accessible knowledge gives way to more and better knowledge.

# Community

## The Open Source Community

https://opensource.com/government/10/10/what-open-source-community

The *global* open source community is an international group of independent collaborators that develops and maintains freely available software, emphasizing transparency, inclusivity, and diversity. Participation can lead to a sense of belonging, skill development, networking opportunities, and the thrill of contributing to a public good.

https://medium.com/@djhersh/community-software-is-dead-431d9f347ee6

The traditional model of community-driven software development is no longer effective due to fragmentation and lack of vision. Instead, companies should focus on building tribes of like-minded individuals who work together to create software that meets their specific needs.

https://medium.com/sustainable-free-and-open-source-communities/we-need-sustainable-free-and-open-source-communities-edf92723d619

Sustainable communities around open source software are crucial to avoid burnout and project abandonment. Building diverse and inclusive communities with clear governance structures and funding models can help achieve this goal. The "Open Collective" model can be used to support funding and transparency.
